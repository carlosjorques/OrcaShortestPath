# OrcaShortestPath

This repository includes the projects in Python and C++ to analyze and solve Orca's shortest path challenge
(see https://github.com/orca-io/orca-challenges/tree/master/challenge-shortest-path)

The solution follows a gradient descent method by formulating the problem with a parametrization of the intermediate points in each gateway.
